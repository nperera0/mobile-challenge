## Project Description
In this project, we're going to be creating a simple app that shows a Wave user the products that they can charge for on their invoices. 

You'll be using the public Wave API in this challenge. You can find the documentation [here](http://docs.waveapps.io/). You will specifically be interested in [the products endpoint](http://docs.waveapps.io/endpoints/products.html#get--businesses-business_id-products-), and [using an access token with the API](http://docs.waveapps.io/oauth/index.html#use-the-access-token-to-access-the-api). 

### What your application must do:

1. Your app must retrieve the list of products for the specific business ID sent to you by your Wave contact
1. The list of products should be fetched and shown to the user in a list view when the app is launched.
1. Each item in the list view should show the product name and price (formatted as a dollar amount.)

You are not required to add any interactivity to the app -- i.e. you do not need to send the user to a detail view when they touch one of the list items. 

Your app is allowed to render nothing if there is no internet connection when it loads.

Once you're done, please submit a paragraph or two in your `README` about what you are particularly proud of in your implementation, and why.

## Evaluation
Evaluation of your submission will be based on the following criteria. 

1. Did your application fulfill the basic requirements?
1. Did you document the method for setting up and running your application?
1. Did you follow the instructions for submission?
